(Baby how's your life?
Are you living free?
Let's forget everything
and have some fun
CHU CHU CHU)
Here we roll dice,
here we cast dice,
here we just Play Dice!
Baby, baby there's no need to
think twice
Dari wari woah
Make it your night,
make it your fight,
make it your spotlight
Get out from the hamster wheel
and rule your life
5 4 3 2 1 PLAY DICE!
(Hey, hey) (Bae, bae)
(Hey, hey) (Bae, bae)
(Hey, hey) (Bae, bae)
Baby~
So the space went "bang" and
we were all born,
the order we knew,
ripped and torn.
But we have no time to complain
'Cause life is short,
can't do it over again.
If we can laugh,
it doesn't matter where or when
Be 自チュウ奔放
Physics don't play the dice?
So let trouble stir and rise!
Be limits, bounds,
rules or chains…
意味なんてな あ あ い
So we don't give a CHU
ヤなことはそっとMute
So find something new
身体中一瞬で夢中 Ha!
No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
No cage can trap this rat (Bae!)
Here we roll dice,
here we cast dice,
here we just Play Dice!
Yell and scream come on now,
don't be too nice
Dari wari woah
Follow your heart,
pump your fist up,
come and join the club
Go and scream for you
the one who's flying free
カオスのダイスのままでいい
For this moment
I am truly really me!
5 4 3 2 1 Play Dice!
Blah blah blah blah

Now here I will recite to you
The only thing
that will hold true
YOLO is my ninja way
It's time put those moves out
there on display
Why stress about tomorrow
when you've got today?
Be 余チュウ綽々
今が最高か最低かなんて
誰も知らない
人生 鼠生チュウ生って
マジでみじか あ あ い
Wow, aren't we sick as CHU?
我々ってエグいCute
So rush on to our route
花火走らせ まるで電流 Ha!
No math can settle this rat
(Bae!)
No math can settle this rat
(Bae!)
No math can settle this rat
(Bae!)
Here we roll dice,
here we cast dice,
here we just Play Dice!
Come and venture into my
dope dumpsite
Dari wari woah
Time to run and follow our sun,
won't stop till we're done
Idiots are allowed infinite fun
みんな自由じゃなきゃ
もったいないじゃん
It's never too late,
our journey's just begun!
If you hesitate on what to do,
that's it, game over.
You are screwed.
泣いても笑ってもCHU CHU CHU
Baby, baby, it's our time!
(CHU CHU CHU)
Here we roll dice,
here we cast dice,
here we just Play Dice!
Baby, baby,
there's no need to think twice
Dari wari woah
This is our night,
this is our fight,
this is our spotlight
Before giving in,
go show them your best try!
後悔しちゃったら
もう生ききれない!
WHATCHU DOING BRUH
GO OUT AND LIVE YOUR LIFE!
