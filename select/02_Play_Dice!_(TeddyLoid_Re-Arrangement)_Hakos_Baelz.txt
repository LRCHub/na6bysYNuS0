(Baby, how's your life?
Are you living free?
Let's forget everything and have some fun
Chu, chu, chu)
Rolling the dice, ignoring the physics,
Playing the game, without all the gimmicks,
Hololive Rarris, don’t need me no civics,
I’m living this life, so don’t listen to critics,
Free as a bird, i’m the knight of wind,
A Black knight like sonic, the sword is my pen,
Vshojo like genius, so shoutout hen,
And i’m feeling too cyber, treya like zen,
Flying like fairies, but i’m never a fae,
Light up the show for a wicked display,
Aiming like kronii, so pass me the ray,
Idol like brats, but shoutout to bae,
Getting it now, don’t need to think twice,
It’s boredom i hate, to be more precise,
Throw in excitement, to mix up the spice,
This life that i’m living, i’m gonna play dice!
Breaking the bounds, the rules, and chains,
The excitement it builds i feel in my brain,
New sweater, i swap when i hop off the plane,
I do it so easy, don’t need to explain,
(Rati-rata-rat-rat)
Trying to trap me, i swear there’s no cage,
Gremiore in hand, as i flip through a page,
We’re Yelling and screaming as we burn through the rage,
Follow your heart, and go hop on that stage,
Rolling the dice, ignoring the physics,
Playing the game, without all the gimmicks,
Hololive Rarris, don’t need me no civics,
I’m living this life, so don’t listen to critics,
Free as a bird, i’m the knight of wind,
A Black knight like sonic, the sword is my pen,
Vshojo like genius, so shoutout hen,
And i’m feeling too cyber, treya like zen,
Flying like fairies, but i’m never a fae,
Light up the show for a wicked display,
Aiming like kronii, so pass me the ray,
Idol like brats, but shoutout to bae,
(Chu, chu, chu)
Getting it now, don’t need to think twice,
It’s boredom i hate, to be more precise,
Throw in excitement, to mix up the spice,
This life that i’m living, i’m gonna play dice!
Blah, blah, blah, blah
